        "description": "Unusual taste and odour reported in tap water",
        "category": "utilities",
        "location": "London, Ontario (varies by neighbourhood, including south and east London)",
        "severity": "low",
        "summary": "Some residents in London report that their tap water occasionally has a strange or unpleasant taste or smell, often described as musty, earthy, or chlorine-like. These concerns are typically seasonal and linked to natural organic compounds in source lakes or routine water treatment processes. Municipal testing indicates the water remains safe to drink, making this primarily an aesthetic and quality-of-life issue rather than a health concern."
